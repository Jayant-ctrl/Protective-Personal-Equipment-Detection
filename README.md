<h1 align="center">Protective-Personal-Equipment-Detection</h1>

#### â–¶ The project uses YOLOv8 Deep Learning Model to detect the presence of Protective-Personal-Equipment like Hard hats, Masks, Safety Jacket etc. on top of people's clothes.

## ðŸŽ†Features
####  1. The model weight is YOLOv8l.pt. It is bigger in size but more accurate than YOLOv8n.pt or YOLOv8s.pt.
####  2. Further model is converted to NCNN format for faster inference speeds on Raspberry Pi.

## ðŸ’ŽDownsides
####  1. The model with large weights runs slowly on a CPU. So prefer using a GPU for good realtime detection.
####  2. We can use YOLOv8n.pt or YOLOv8s.pt i.e. Nano or Small version of the model for much faster inference speeds.
